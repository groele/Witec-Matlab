# Landé g-Factor Data Reader and Calculator

*(Based on [SOFTX-D-20-00088](https://github.com/ElsevierSoftwareX/SOFTX-D-20-00088))*

## Overview

This project is developed **based on the open-source code published in [Elsevier SoftwareX, SOFTX-D-20-00088](https://github.com/ElsevierSoftwareX/SOFTX-D-20-00088)**.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the original authors for their excellent and open work, which laid the foundation for this development.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to **extend the original framework with data reading and preprocessing capabilities**, enabling users to efficiently handle experimental or simulation data stored in Excel files and subsequently calculate the **Landé g-factor**.

## Main Features

* **Excel Data Input**: Automatically read and parse `.xlsx` data files for further analysis.
* **Landé g-Factor Calculation**: Compute the g-factor from imported datasets.
* **Modular Structure**: The data reading and analysis modules can be easily integrated into other workflows.

## How to Use

1. Run the main script to read the data.
2. The program will process the input and calculate the corresponding Landé g-factors.
